# Urban

The urban sequences are collected in Shenyang, China, including numerous highly-dynamic objects and various types of vehicles, which is a prominent research topic in SLAM. It comprises two sequences over 2 km, where many algorithms exhibit significant Z-axis drift.

| urban_02   | 1075.6      | 1217.5      | ⭐⭐⭐⭐      | Afternoon, urban environment, high dynamics, passes a short tunnel, then descends a large slope into the park. | ground truth |
| urban_03   | 454.9       | 528.3       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐      | Afternoon, good lighting, smooth road, passes a short tunnel, medium dynamics. | ground truth |
| urban_04   | 1896.0      | 2430.9      | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐     | Large-scale loop (~2.4km), high dynamics, includes at least 3 buses. | ground truth |
| urban_05   | 2476.6      | 2807.9      | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐     | Large-scale loop (~3km), high dynamics, forward/reverse loops. | ground truth |
