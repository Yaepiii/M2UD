# Open

These sequences are collected along the shores of Bosten Lake in Xinjiang, China, and in the Urumqi gobi, which are uneven-terrain. Along the lakeshore, swaying reeds are abundant as unstable feature points, and LiDAR scans of the lake surface produce invalid reflections, which poses challenges for SLAM. The gobi is open and untraversed. Due to lack of distinctive features, Both LiDAR and visual SLAM often experience degradation.
