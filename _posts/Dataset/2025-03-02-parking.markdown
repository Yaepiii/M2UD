# Parking

Three sequences are recorded in the underground parking to validate SLAM performance in this environment, where various loops are specifically designed to support research on indoor SLAM algorithms.

| Sequence   | Duration (s) | Distance (m) | Difficulty | Description | Ground Truth |
|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| parking_01 | 606.2       | 885.7       | ⭐         | Dynamic elements (2 cars, 5 people), contains forward and reverse loops, returns to origin. | ✓ |
| parking_02 | 671.9       | 986.2       | ⭐         | Dynamic elements (1 car, 2 people), only one long forward loop in the middle, returns to origin. | ✓ |
| parking_03 | 641.8       | 938.7       | ⭐         | Contains forward and reverse loops, though not very long, tests visual loop closure, returns to origin. | ✓ |
