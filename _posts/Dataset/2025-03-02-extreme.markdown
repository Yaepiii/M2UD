# Extreme

The sequences include severe sandstorm and snowfall conditions (rarely found in most wheeled robot datasets), which enables the evaluation of algorithm performance under extreme weather conditions.

| Sequence      | Duration (s) | Distance (m) | Difficulty | Description | Ground Truth |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| extreme_01   | 417.2       | 514.8       | ⭐⭐        | Nighttime recording, strong wind/sandstorm, few dynamic elements, rural scene, noisy features (surrounding plants shaking violently, unstable features). | ground truth |
| extreme_02   | 299.8       | 431.2       | ⭐⭐⭐       | Severe sandstorm + light rain, unstructured scene, few dynamic elements (2 people / 1 car), uneven terrain. | ground truth |
| extreme_03   | 412.9       | 442.7       | ⭐⭐⭐       | Nighttime snowfall, GR flowerbed route. | ground truth |
| extreme_04   | 539.6       | 588.1       | ⭐⭐⭐       | Nighttime light snow, circling a building, multiple forward and reverse loops. | ground truth |
